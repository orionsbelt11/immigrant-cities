The immigrant-cities file will pull and format data from the American Community Survey (ACS) and then calculate the top foreign-born communities within a 20 mile radius (adjustable) of your selected city.
The script then formats the data for plotting a Dasymetric Dot Plot map of the ACS data.

The houston_map script will format OSM data for use as a basemap in your preferred GIS tool.
